# Ledgerly

**Ledgerly** is an open platform for audit automation and compliance.  
It is designed to help auditors and compliance professionals reduce manual work, generate accurate reports, and adapt to different legislative frameworks across countries.

---

## Vision

Ledgerly’s goal is to become a complete PaaS for auditing and compliance by providing:

- AI and machine learning for risk detection and anomaly analysis  
- Localized compliance rule sets for different jurisdictions  
- Automated PDF report generation and templating  
- Email and client communication integration  
- Workflow orchestration for individuals, teams, and firms  
- Extensible plugin architecture for custom regulations and checklists  

---

## Features (MVP and Roadmap)

- Audit templates for reusable and standardized workflows  
- Automated reporting to PDF, Word, and Excel  
- AI-assisted analysis of documents and financial data  
- Legislation packs with region-specific compliance logic  
- Notifications via email for reminders and approvals  
- Secure design with role-based access, encryption, and audit trails  

---

## Proposed Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python (Django, Flask, or FastAPI)  
- **Frontend**: Angular or React  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optional audit logging extensions  
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch, spaCy, Transformers  
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm for deployment  

---

## Example Use Cases

- An auditor runs a compliance check and automatically generates a client-ready PDF report.  
- A firm switches audit logic between EU, US, and local legislation without rewriting workflows.  
- AI highlights unusual transactions for deeper manual investigation.

## Status

Ledgerly is in early development.  
The focus is on building a modular architecture that supports audit templates, AI modules, and compliance packs.
